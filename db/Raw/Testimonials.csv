Kirtan Upadhyaya,Alpha Class,epsilonsprofessional.jpg,0,"Sigma Eta Pi is a toolbox; it enables us to build not on our next big startup, but on ourselves. SEP gave me the confidence and skill set to pursue any future venture in my life."
Andy Yang,Founding Member,etabestclass.jpg,0,"SEP was a time of exploration, an opportunity for growth, and most importantly, a place to call home. New ways of thinking, seeing, and believing come together; the world you used to know becomes much smaller, and the world you didn't know becomes much brighter."
Eric Liu,Founding Member,everyonetahoe.jpg,0,"Sigma Eta Pi is filled with individuals that I can confidently say are my inspiration and my family. We're a little quirky, a lot of fun, and undeniably passionate and talented. I grew immeasurably as a leader and entrepreneur and met my best friends. Hands down the best and most defining part of my college experience."
